/**
 * The live XP economy. XP is earned DURING battle (not only at the bell), across
 * three channels so growth tracks engagement without snowballing:
 *
 *  1. Kill-participation — every unit that damaged or debuffed a foe shares its
 *     XP when it dies (`xpForKill`); the unit that lands the finisher gets a bonus.
 *  2. Action XP — a qualifying action that doesn't kill still pays its actor a
 *     little: an offensive hit on a foe, or a buff/heal/revive on an ally.
 *  3. Battle-clear XP — a fixed grant split equally to the whole party at victory
 *     (present, fallen, or benched) so supports and the bench keep pace.
 *
 * All knobs live here so balance is a one-file tuning pass.
