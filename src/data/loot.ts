 * Chapter/difficulty-scaled loot for END-OF-BATTLE spoils (and small per-enemy
 * drops). Pure: every roll's randomness flows through the passed `RNG`, so a
 * fixed seed reproduces the same haul. Treasure-chest contents are authored on
 * the maps elsewhere — this module only owns the random battle drops.
 *
 * The campaign is 17 phases (0-based). Drops lean by chapter: early fights pay
 * the basic tier (potion/ether), mid fights mix in the mid tier
 * (hiPotion/phoenixDown/hourglass), and late fights unlock the premium tier
 * (xPotion/turboEther/megaPhoenix). Difficulty nudges count and quality: hard
 * rolls a touch more and skews better, easy a touch less.
